# towerdef (Working title)

Design goals:
- No mouse should be necessary, strive to be able to do everything with keyboard.
- Develop suite of debug tools early on to make development easier.
    - Map editor
- Be a proper example of how to use Amethyst. Document everything.
- Add tests where necessary.

Brainstorm ideas for tools:
- Dynamite
- Tunnel bore machine
- Ladder
- Balloons that go up, attachable to tools/blocks? Moves tools to where you can actualy use them.
- Water streams to move tools or blocks?

TODO:
- Break 1 / 2 blocks horizontally
- Break 1 / 2 blocks below
- Moveable blocks
